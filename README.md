## Key Features

* **Raw Ionite FE**
  A powerful new energy type generated by special reactors. While Ionite FE cannot be directly used by machines, it can be converted into extremely large amounts of standard FE, making it a high-tier power system.

* **New Alloys**
  Expand your crafting possibilities with durable and versatile alloys:

  * **Wuffram Alloy** – exceptionally durable and used in high-tier machines.
  * **Steel** – a strong mid-tier metal for tools, machines, and components.
  * **Brass** – useful in machinery and intermediate crafting.
  * **Tungsten** – a high-strength material with late-game applications.

* **Cell System**
  Store and transport fluids more efficiently with **Cells**. Liquids can be inserted into cells for compact storage and automation, simplifying large-scale setups.
